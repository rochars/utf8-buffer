https://github.com/rochars/utf8-buffer/tree/master/dist

## Use

### Node
If you installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), **import utf8Buffer from utf8-buffer**:
```javascript
import * as utf8Buffer from 'utf8-buffer';
let packed = utf8Buffer.pack('\uFFFD');
```

Or **import** just what you need:
```javascript
import {pack} from 'utf8-buffer';
let packed = pack('\uFFFDð¯§Ÿ');
```

Or **require**:
```javascript
const utf8Buffer = require('utf8-buffer');
let packed = utf8Buffer.pack('ï§¸ß¹~');
```

### Browser
Use **utf8-buffer.umd.js** in the */dist* folder of this package:
```html
<script src="./dist/utf8-buffer.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  var packed = utf8Buffer.pack('$ð’ˆ“eita');
</script>
```

Or load it from the [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/utf8-buffer) CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/utf8-buffer"></script>

## About
Only UTF-8 strings with a max of 4 bytes per character are supported. **BOM** is kept untouched. Invalid characters are replaced with *Unicode Character 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFD)*.

### Browser compatibility
Should work in all modern browsers. Cross-browser tests are on the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/rochars/utf8-buffer/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

## API
```javascript
/**
 * Read a string of UTF-8 characters from a byte buffer.
 * Invalid characters are replaced with 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' (U+FFFD).
 * @see https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#the-encoding
 * @see https://stackoverflow.com/a/34926911
 * @param {!Uint8Array|!Array<!number>} buffer A byte buffer.
 * @param {number=} index The index to read.
 * @param {?number=} len The number of bytes to read.
 *    If len is undefined will read until the end of the buffer.
 * @return {string}
 */
export function unpack(buffer, index=0, len=null) {}

/**
 * Write a string of UTF-8 characters as a byte buffer.
 * @see https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-encoder
 * @param {string} str The string to pack.
 * @return {!Uint8Array} The packed string.
 */
export function pack(str) {}
